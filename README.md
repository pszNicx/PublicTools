Utilities
=========

These are just a collection of small tools I've written primarily for my own personal use but anyone's free to use them.

- **ListDependencies** - Point it to a .NET assembly (.dll or .exe) and it will list out all the dependencies of the assembly.
- **RtfCleanup** - Strips out the bulk of the markup code from an `.rtf` file and turns it into a plain text file.
